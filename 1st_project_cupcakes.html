            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 1: Preheat and Prep</strong></p>
	          <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
	          <li><strong>Line Muffin Tin:</strong> Line your 12-cup muffin tin with paper cupcake liners. This prevents sticking and makes for easy cleanup.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 2: Combine Dry Ingredients</strong></p>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. This ensures that the leavening agent (baking powder) and salt are evenly distributed.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</strong></p>
            <li>In your large mixing bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer), add the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Using an electric mixer, beat on medium speed until the mixture is light, fluffy, and pale in color. This usually takes 2-3 minutes. This process, called "creaming," incorporates air into the butter and sugar, which contributes to the cupcakes' light texture.</li>

          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</strong>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time to the creamed butter and sugar mixture, beating well after each addition until just combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with your rubber spatula to ensure everything is well mixed.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 5: Alternate Dry and Wet Ingredients</strong>
            <p>This step is crucial for the texture of your cupcakes.</p>
            <li><strong>Add 1/3 of Dry Ingredients:</strong> With the mixer on low speed, gradually add about one-third of your dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix!</li>
            <li><strong>Add 1/2 of Milk:</strong> Pour in half of the milk and mix until just incorporated.</li>
            <li><strong>Add 1/3 of Dry Ingredients:</strong> Add another third of the dry ingredients and mix.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Remaining Milk:</strong> Add the remaining milk and mix.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Remaining Dry Ingredients:</strong> Finish by adding the final third of the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined and no streaks of flour remain. Stop mixing as soon as the flour disappears. Overmixing develops the gluten in the flour, leading to tough cupcakes.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 6: Fill Cupcake Liners</strong><p>
            <li>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, evenly divide the batter among the 12 cupcake liners. Fill each liner about two-thirds full. This allows room for the cupcakes to rise without overflowing.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 7: Bake!</strong>
            <li>Place the muffin tin in your preheated oven.</li>
           <li>Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. The tops should be lightly golden and spring back when gently touched.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Step 8: Cool</strong><p>
            <li>Once baked, remove the muffin tin from the oven. Let the cupcakes cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the cupcakes to a wire cooling rack to cool completely before frosting. Frosting warm cupcakes will cause the frosting to melt.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <p><strong>Final step!</strong></p>
            <p>Once your cupcakes are completely cool, you can frost them with your favorite buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or glaze. Get creative with sprinkles, edible glitter, or fruit!</p>
          </ol>

          <ul>
            <p><strong>Tips for Success:</strong></p>
            <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> This is super important! Room temperature butter, eggs, and milk emulsify better, creating a smoother batter and a more even crumb.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> As mentioned, overmixing leads to tough cupcakes. Mix only until ingredients are just combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Overfill:</strong> Filling the liners too much will result in overflowing, mushroom-topped cupcakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Rotate Pan (Optional):</strong> If your oven has hot spots, you can rotate the muffin tin halfway through baking for more even browning.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store unfrosted cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Frosted cupcakes can be stored at room temperature for a day or two, or in the refrigerator for longer, depending on the frosting.</li>
          <p>Happy baking, and enjoy your delicious homemade cupcakes!</p>
