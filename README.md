My First Website - A Cupcake Tutorial
This project is a simple cupcake recipe website, and it marks my first step into the world of web development.

My Journey
As a quantitative trader in my 30s, I had a slight understanding of coding, but I decided to learn how to build a website with HTML from scratch.

I learned everything from zero, step by step. I built this first website entirely without any help from AI because I wanted to ensure my understanding of the fundamentals was as strong as possible. I am very proud of it.

In an era where everything is becoming easier, I miss the feeling of old-school effort.

To an expert, this might look like a plain and simple webpage. But for me, it represents a huge starting point in my self-development and in taking my knowledge to the next level.

I will continue to improve myself, little by little.
